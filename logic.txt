Set up the HTML structure: Create HTML file with the necessary elements such as a display screen, number buttons, operator buttons and other functional buttons.
Create variables: Declare variables to store the first number, operator, second number and the current display value.
Create event listeners: Add click event listeners to the number buttons, operator buttons, equals button, clear button, decimal button and backspace button.
Implement functions for number buttons: Create a function to handle the click event of number buttons. Inside the function, update the display value by appending the clicked number to the current display value. 
Implement functions for operator buttons: Create a function to handle the click event of operator buttons. Inside the function, store the clicked operator in the operator variable and update the first number variable with the current display. Clear the display value for the next input.
Implement function for equals button (=): Create a function to handle the click event of the equals button. Inside the function, update the second number variable with the current display value. Call the operate() function, passing the operator and the first and second numbers as arguments. Update the display value with the result of the operation.
Implement function for clear button (C): Create a function to handle the click event of the clear button. Inside the function, reset all variables to their initial values and clear the display.
Implement function for decimal button (.): Create a function to handle the click event of the decimal button. Inside the function, check if the display value already contains a decimal point. If not, append a decimal point to the display.
Implement function for backspace button (<-): Create a function to handle the click event of the backspace button. Inside the function, remove the last character from the display value.
Implement the operate() function: Create a function called operate() that takes an operator and two numbers as arguments. Inside the function, use a switch statement to perform the appropriate mathematical operation based on the operator. Return the result of the operation.
Handle division by zero: Check for division by zero in the operate() function. If the second number is zero and the operator is division, display an error message instead of performing the division.
